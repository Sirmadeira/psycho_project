# The Psycho Project

*Welcome, newcomers! This marks the beginning of my game development journey!*

This game aims to capture the essence of the long-dead duel games, reminiscent of an era I dearly miss. 
Since waiting for a sequel became tiresome, I've taken it upon myself to create one.

I aspire for this game to become both competitive and immensely enjoyable.

## MAIN IDEAS
  * Modular character customization - So I can later add multiple skins and utilze of ragdolls and so on.
  * UI the idea of betting in your dueling skill
  * Extremely dynamic movement - Dashes, parry gun play and sword play 

## TIPS for myself
  * When reutilizing MIXAMO animations, always import from it  with skin, it gets buggy if you dont.
  * Search for things like catwalk for the female character they look hella sexy
  * IF YOU WANT TO ADD OFFSET VIA NLA like put the arm a little to the side on, BAKE THE ANIMATIONS follow this step by step https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/277082/export-mixed-nla-editor-data
  * IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR ANIMATION IN PLACE JUST DISABLE THE AXIS LOCATION OF THE HIP BONE (TECHNICALLY THE ROOT BONE) in mixamo, you can chose the axis.
  * PAY ATTENTION TO WHEN THE CLIP ENDS
  * Always point the character to the positive ye
