# The Psycho Project

*Welcome, newcomers! This marks the beginning of my game development journey!*

This game aims to capture the essence of the long-dead duel games, reminiscent of an era I dearly miss. 
Since waiting for a sequel became tiresome, I've taken it upon myself to create one.

I aspire for this game to become both competitive and immensely enjoyable.

Cheerios,
Sirmadeira!
